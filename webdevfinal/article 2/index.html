    <h4> April 8, 2023</h4>
    <p>The topic of mental illness has been a taboo subject in the Black community for a long time. This leads to misinformation and ignorance around the topic. Mental health treatment is not seen as a priority the way physical illness is. According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, 1 in 5 adults in the United States experience mental illness each year. Regardless of race or religious affiliation. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Minority Health, adult Black/African Americans are 20 percent more likely to report serious psychological distress than adult Whites. Despite this, Black people are less likely than White people to seek professional help. Most shy away from seeking help or even addressing their mental issues out of fear of being seen as “crazy” or even being shunned by other members of their community.
      Young Black people for decades have been constantly bombarded with poor representation in film and television. Whether that be a lack of representation or harmful stereotypes. Stereotyping has been prominent in racism forever and still affects groups today. For example, the way Black women are portrayed on screen can warp their own perception of themselves and the way others see them. Black women must deal with racism and sexism therefore their experience with stereotypes and microaggressions and the way that affects their mental health is unique because of how normalized it has become and the lack of diverse representation of Black women in the media. Black women have been portrayed in three harmful stereotypes in film and television over the years such as the Strong Black Woman, the Angry Black Woman, and the Jezebel/Video Vixen. While there are of course many Strong Black Women in the world, the need to keep up with this stereotype can have negative effects. The pressure to “keep on keeping on” can make one completely abandon their own mental health. The Angry Black Woman trope, as it states, portrays Black women as angry and hostile. The Jezebel/Video Vixen trope hypersexualizes Black women and views them as immoral and shameless. This trope can affect black girls from an incredibly young age. This projection of stereotypes can cause anxiety disorder later in their lives.  
      The main factor contributing to many of issues the Black community faces, however, is systemic racism. Systemic racism is a form of racism embedded within society or through an organization. Systemic racism is extremely dangerous when it comes to the healthcare system. Racism in doctors and health professionals can lead to misdiagnoses and poor treatment. These issues have been present for generations within the Black community. Black people are historically disadvantaged and subject to trauma through enslavement, racially motivated violence, and segregation. Unaddressed generational or ancestral trauma such as this can lead to increased mental illness.
      To begin repairing the strained relationship between Black women and mental health, we must first acknowledge it. Black directors today are making progress in putting out positive representation for Black girls in the future to in turn give them higher self esteem and to better acknowledge their mental health.
