    <h4> February 11, 2023</h4>
    <p> There are all kinds of trends circulating TikTok everyday. One in particular that originated back in summer of 2022, the “clean girl” aesthetic sparked conversation. Initially, the trend seemed harmless. A simple slick back bun, small gold hoops, simple makeup was all you needed to achieve the look. But upon further inspection of the trend, many TikTok users noticed the lack of diversity in the trend. The clean girl trend tends to put thin white women at its forefront, alienating BIPOC women, fat women, women with disabilities and women with acne-prone skin. Along with that alienation many noticed that the aesthetic of the clean girl is not new at all. The trend doesn’t give credit to the Black and Latin women that innovated it. For decades many of the elements associated with the clean girl aesthetic, particularly gold hoops and slick back buns, were popular amongst those communities. The reason this is an issue is because when Black and brown women sported these looks years ago, they would be called “ghetto” or “trashy”. This is not to say that no one else can wear hoops or buns but it is certainly worth mentioning how the trend originated and question why those women are not being represented.
  
  Since the clean girl trend, other trends have emerged such as the “vanilla girl” trend. This trend goes even further with the main elements being white or cream colored clothing such as cashmere sweaters and Uggs with minimal makeup, expensive perfume and blonde hair. Many have described the trend as being just a remixed version of the clean girl trend but even more exclusionary. This begs the question of when BIPOC women will be properly represented in the beauty space. </p>
