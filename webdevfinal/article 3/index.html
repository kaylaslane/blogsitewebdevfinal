  One of the latest TikTok trends is “deinfluencing” the act of convincing yourself that you don’t need something you see your favorite content creator promoting. Social media is filled with creators trying the latest products. Whether it be clothes, makeup, skincare, or accessories (like the Stanely water bottle!). 
  
  It’s easy to be influenced and want the latest trendy things. I’ve personally fallen for it several times. But is this good for our wallets? Our self-esteem? Or even the environment? 
  
  Microtrends on TikTok and Instagram feed into the pressure that especially younger people feel to fit in and consume. The most popular fad on TikTok is the skincare obsession. TikToks about “how to get glass skin”, “get ready with me” or influencers showing off their 12-step skincare routines take up a considerable amount of our For You pages. While videos like this seem harmless on the surface, they’re actually encouraging their audiences of young women to buy things they don’t need to solve problems they didn’t know they had. There’s also an underlying anti-aging agenda behind it all. Ads for retinol eye cream or special straws to prevent wrinkles are some of the many products users have reported seeing promotions for. With teenagers to women in their 20s being the most impressionable on this side of TikTok, the anti-aging agenda is a sinister way of making them think there is something wrong with naturally aging and in turn makes them buy things they don’t need.
      So much of what we buy just because of what an influencer told us too often goes unused or unworn and ends up in landfills (contributing to the worsening climate crisis). As Gen-Z makes attempts to steer away from capitalism and consumerism and become more sustainable, the act of “deinfluencing” is becoming even more popular. TikTok users are helping their viewers make better decisions regarding what they buy by talking about items they were influenced into buying and how they’ve never actually used them.
  
  There’s nothing wrong with treating yourself every once in a while though. But it’s important to ask yourself why you’re buying something, if it’s necessary, and if you’ll still want it in a year after it’s no longer the new trendy thing to own.
