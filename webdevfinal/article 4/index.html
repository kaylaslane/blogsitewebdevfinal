  The “Social Thriller” is defined as a film genre that uses horror elements such as suspense and fear to comment on social inequity in our society. While it can be dated back to the 1970s, the term gained popularity with the release Jordan Peele’s Get Out in 2017, which follows a black man who, while meeting his. white girlfriend’s family, discovers their plot to abduct and lobotomize him. The film does a great commentary on casual and systemic racism and how dangerous it is. Peele drew inspiration for this film from the 1967 comedy-drama film directed by Stanley Kramer Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner which also follows a black man meeting the family of his white girlfriend and describes it as a horror/thriller take on that premise. 
  
  This genre has been described as a “reinvention of horror.” Throughout these versions, the expectations of the audience of what a thriller/horror movie is are subverted by teaching its audience a hard truth about reality and racism, the true evils of the world. One of the earliest films that critics have been considered a Social Thriller is 1968’s Night of the Living Dead. This film follows a black man who is trapped in a house with 6 white people during a zombie apocalypse. Many have noticed how the white people in the house almost depend on the black man to survive. While this may have been unintentional on Director George Romero’s part, the film is seen as a racial critique. The black main character is depicted as the “comparatively calm and resourceful African American”, he is resourceful and so prepared to face the zombies on account of having to face the real-life horrors of racism his entire life. The time when the film was released is also important as it was at the end of the civil rights movement and at a time where it was rare to see a black man in a leading role- a horror especially. </p>
